# Flask-Perspective-API

This project uses Perspectice API to detect toxicity in a sentence and then uses funny words library to replace it with something funny. The process is present as a flask project which can be simply run by running the app.py file. However you'll need to provide your own perspective API key which should be fairly easy to procure
